Review
"First of all its a Gautham Menon film,lot of ups and downs,twist and turns yet its totally different from all the other movies its a Masterpiece given by him,the story deals with a simple relationship between father and son,but said in a extraordinary way. Its a visual treat for audience gave by Surya and Sameera Reddy on one half- The brighter part of the film deals with the childhood days with his dad and most beautiful part of the film his love with Megnha ,and the movie turns dark when Megnha dies,and Surya goes mad couldn't bare her loss,he goes on 2 drugs,then once again his hero-Dad comes in his life changes everything around him,turns his negatives into positives creating him a major in the Indian ARMY.The best of the film are is memories with his father...THANK u Gautham Menon for giving this film its not just a film its a fragment of my heart.."
"This movie was well made with nice melodious songs. What I really like about this movie was that it showed how fathers are important as well. Most movies always talk about mother as the motivation and somehow portray the dad as military style attitude or just thrown in for show but this movie was all about a dad's motivation, a dad who was living and compassionate. As for the actors: They really created magic with this movie. Surya was amazing. He really dug into the characters' role equally. His expressions and flawless Hindi and Tamil made this movie very enjoyable as well as his dual role. His attitude kept changing so it held the audience's eyes. Sameera Reddy was also wonderful. Despite the limited screen time, she really made a strong impact. Simran was also great. It has been a long time since I have seen her and her presence made the movie pleasant. Divya Spandana was not bad at all. I felt that she was thrown in but there needed to be something to make the movie going. The songs were very nice and melodious. Although it was not very fast paced, the creative sounds made it worthwhile. Only negative thought: I really wished that there were subtitles so that we could understand what Hindi words were spoken. Overall, this movie had a little bit of everything: love, violence, adventure, music and it is a definite must watch."

13. MOST IMPORTANT FATHER - SON DUO RELATIONSHIPI have seen a number of movies, but none of them is like this one. Am sure, none of this decade or upcoming movies could be like this one. Hope, this movie exists forever.
Watching this movie is like finding 'The Best In Quintillion'.Story writer has shown an entire life story of Surya and Krishnan in a single movie. This movie is dedicated to every father son duo.Story beautifully depicts an ideal relationship between father and son. I can feel my dad's presence in Krishnan's role. Love you Dad üíù.Background music is so charming, it drags feelings out of us."
"Vaaranam Aayiram--itz Surya all the way...He roxx to the core....What a versatility he gave to the different phases of his character... As a teenager, lover, loser, commando, aged man his performance is top class...His body language and voice modulation all are excellent...I can say..now he is in big league with the finest actors of our country...Coming to the film....itz an autobiographical one...so we cant blame the pace of the movie...Even though the narration is racy in first half. In second half there are lot of incidents...(transition from a loser to a good individual..) Surya-Sameera reddy love track is minty cool..n Surya-Divya track is also OK...Then the Delhi episode...IMO itz a refreshing idea frm Goutham..(To overcome the loss of tragic event in Hero's life..)Someone may not agree that...After that the army scenes...surya really looks like an army man...And the final dialogue from simran is also touching...Performancewise Surya...His career best performance till date....Next comes Simran...Matured performance ..Both Sameera and Divya are apt for the roles...No gimmicks in Cinematography and Editing...BGM and music is beautifully synchronised with the mood of the film....If you are looking for a masala entertainer, then stay away from here...Overall, itz a must watch ...."
"From the first scene to the very last bit, everything was well crafted in excellence. The real magic in this movie is definitely Surya's acting. At first I was wondering why is he casted again as a double role acting, he has done that several times like the one in Vel. However, I was amazed at his abilities in creating distinctive traits to each of these character; the father and son. You would find his fatherly acting is similar to the late Raghuvaran, another great actor. Despite being involved in two roles, he managed to create different personalities as he grew up as a child to adulthood. In short, you don't need to create 10 characters (rings the bell) to portray your talents in acting, the important things is to be the role itself and how the audiences are impacted.The songs are superb. Plainly one of Harris Jeyaraj's classics after Minnale. It is a disappointment that Gautham and Harris have ended their ties, as their duo seem to come up with masterpieces. Not forgetting cinematography, you don't get much of boring static shots; it's either dramatic, or simply keeps you wanting to know more about the next scene.Though a little draggy ( the flaw ) , overall this a Tamil movie you shouldn't miss. Every single character has brought out their role well, Simran as Surya's mum played her character too neatly and well, leaving you praising her performance at the end of the movie.After watching this movie, it won't really leave you for a few days most a week. That much impact.Watch it, you may find the usual Tamil movie clich√©s, but it will leave you satisfied as you step out the theater or living room."
"This is the kinda movie that you don't mind watching again and again. It's just one a kind. And these are the kinda movies which would bring our entire Tamil cinema to the next level. I walked out of the cinema telling myself, that I had just watched a beautiful Tamil movie. Everything was beautiful about the movie. Surya, to start off with as the father and son duo.. He was just simply awesome. He carried himself so well and at every point he marked his signature. Simran to being with, played her role beautifully and with much demure. It was really nice to see Simran acting again and yeah dancing on screen. I just so missed her absence. Loved the way how Gautham has used her in this movie. Sameera and Divya were both at the best and no one can say they are mediocre performers or just plain dumb blonds after this movie. They played their roles up to perfection and left a lasting impression in our minds. All the songs were beautiful and in particular I loved the ""Anjala"" song, I never knew it was such a sad song until I watched the movie. On the overall its a movie for all the wonderful fathers in the world.. Its a dedication to all those loving daddies.. A real lovely movie for all! Dun miss it!"
"""Whatever happens life has to go on¬Ö"" an important phrase in the film Vaaram Aayiram written and directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon. The film is about a Father- Son relationship where Suriya (the protagonist) organize all his memories at the moment when he is on a mission (an army mission) while he heard about the demise of his father. Suriya went back through the times which he had spent with his father. It also welcomes you into the world of love; the eternity and divinity of that wonderful feeling."
"'Vaaranam Aayiram' tells the story about the life journey of a son who is positively motivated by his father and how he goes through emotions like love,passion,success and failure and how he is driven to search for himself in this challenging world..... the movie seems to have lot of similarities with the Tom Hanks starring Hollywood movie 'Forrest Gump' which is definitely and obviously a better version of 'Vaaranam Aayiram'....but,it is definitely considered as a very good attempt from the viewpoint of Tamil cinema as the music and cinematography of the movie takes Tamil cinema to the next level.....Surya's performance in the dual role as both father and son is mind blowing as he has delivered a complete performance.....Gautham Menon's smart direction, Harris Jayaraj's superb songs and background scores,Rathnavelu's brilliant cinematography are giant pillars carrying the movie in their shoulders.....a great story about the relationship between a father and a son.....'Vaaranam Aayiram' could have been more of a classic if the makers could have avoided compromise in certain aspects of the movie....."
"I have never reviewed a film on IMDb before, but Varnam Ayiurm deserves some special recognition. I was absolutely enthralled from beginning to end. Varanam Ayiurm is loosely based on Tom Hank's Forest Gump, as Surya travels the world and undertakes different adventures to find and secure his love. Of course his path is full of twists and turns that push him to his mental and physical extremes.This story is beautifully displayed through breathtaking cinematography. Each scene was shot with care and diligence which makes a modest budget film, look like a billion bucks. Glad to see that the money was well used instead of ravishing over gold necklaces and over-the-top song sequences like Sankar's Shivagi and Annyian. Surya's is at the top of his game with another riveting performance. He is definitely one of the best in the business!The one criticism I do have about this movie;this might sound weird, but I believe the movie was hampered in its feel and realism with the overuse of the English language. The English words drained passion from the dialogue, especially the ""I made love to her...Daddy"" line. What was supposed to be a very emotional moment almost made me laugh! Other than that, this movie is a 10/10 in my books and a definite must see to all movie goers!"
"It has been 16 years since ""Vaaranam Aayiram"" hit cinemas, and yet I haven't really had the chance to watch it - until now, that is. Often considered a cult-film of sorts with its die-hard following, it was interesting to see what about this movie really connected with people to stand the test of time the way it has.While I personally found the movie to be rather dated; with its overly melodramatic fairytale-like approach to everything, it still had enough charisma and charm to be an attractive movie. Of course, it does compel us to cooperate with the whole ""love at first sight"" concept (something that is as fictitiously regressive as can be), trying to play it off as something more meaningful than what it essentially is - lust or worse, delusional thinking. But ignoring that, it has some quotable moments, manufactured melodrama, songs that have grown to be an integral part of Tamil pop culture, and of course, some adorable familial relationship dynamics.I can't say that I was impressed, but I certainly wasn't disappointed. It was as 2000s a movie as I could have wanted, and it was fun being finally able to watch a movie that people so dearly recount with nostalgia."
"Even though Menon is a mediocre director who always tries to app the last English movie he has seen, this one is very bad. The joke is they thought they will show a boys evolution into man and did not have a good scene to show a brilliant actor a Surya a boy or as a man. He does not finish collage but makes enough money to build a house, finish off all the debts and fly to America and live in there for 90 days. I know in Tamil movies we don't make logical or cerebral movies but this is beyond Tamil movie formula(it is worse than what Vikraman dishes out ever 2 years). They are poor and live a house better than any who went to see the movie. He takes a road trip which is the English movie inspiration and goes to Simla, Delhi and solves a crime- that is rich and original. Surya plays a duel role like in Vikraman movies and the sad part is Surya tries to make a mediocre screen play into a Balas movie and he must understand Menon is a run of the mill Tamil movie director. The worst Surya movie, worse than the old movies he made before he learn t to act."
may be many of your friends may say it is a good movie.....That is Even your good friend will lie ..... This movie is simply wasting the extraordinary potentials of Surya. He is crying so much for Sameera reddy death rather then his fathers. Spotting Black images with every single shot simply irritating the audience. Harris Rocks!!!! as useful...... After interval i don't know why he is going to Kashmir?? and Why he is joining Army??.And one thing i can't digest is in the second half Surya tries to show his 6 packs by not wearing shirts is too much.. I know He is working hard but these kinds of commercials are not needed for this kind of dramas.Anyway Big applause to camera man becoz he struggled to show surya to match sameera's height.OK whatever it is.... if you can't sleep in your home just go for this movie.
"""Vaaranam Aayiram"" is a true and an honest attempt at making a realistic and meaningful Tamil film. The screenplay revolves around the most famous middle class in the world conversing in fluent English and it has all the elements that are most common within this group; studying MS in USA for instance. The direction is outstanding in some places and mostly good at other times. Gautam's conception of the Train scenes between Surya and Sameera Reddy is extremely refreshing. Harris Jeyaraj's music is of utmost quality, especially in the ""Adiye Kolluthey"" and ""Nenjukkul Peidhidum"" songs and that is evident from the fact that ""Adiye Kolluthey"" song was the first Tamil song to be played on V Channel.Simran is perfect as a charming girl from the 70's and very gracious and respectable mother of the 90's. Sameera Reddy shows a lot of signs of good acting skills in addition to the oomph factor. Divya comes across as a very sensible lady expressing her thoughts with subtle emotions. The art director shows his brilliance when he brings to life the streets of 70's and 90's and the beauty of San Francisco bridge.The actor, who eclipses everybody else with ease including the director, is Surya. Nobody would believe if he is the same actor after watching him in ""Nerukku Ner"" in 1998. He is growing by leaps and bounds in every movie and stands now as one of the real acting talents of the current generation in line with Vikram. He is extremely honorable as a father (except for some makeup goof-ups) and a truly pitiable young man having lost the love of his life. Not many actors can transform themselves completely to look like a teenager in such an incredibly realistic manner. Not stopping there, Surya has also taken extreme measures to build six packs and look like an Army Major that would even make some of the real military personnel feel ashamed. His dedication and acting abilities seem to be a serious contender for Kamal's ingenious work seen recently in Dasavathaaram."
Vaaranam aayiram is one of the best cult flim in Indian cinema. It is not a flim it is an experience. Every youngsters should watch this movie. Life is very beautiful. This flim proves that. My rating 10/10..
This is the greatest movie made in Tamil film industry.
"This movie is definitely a justified triumph for Surya and Gautham Menon. The whole movie doesn't drag AT ALL except A BIT in the last. Sameera looks really pretty with the work of the make up artists. The Camera Men also have worked extremely hard and hats off to Aascar films for producing this film. But the main part of the cast and crew who steal the show Surya and Gautham Menon and Harris Jayaraj whose melodies and rock are worth their weight in Gold. The songs, Adiyae Kolluthae and Nenjukkul Peidhidhum are worth listening a hundred times a day and so are Mundhinam and Oh! Shanti. Ana Mene and Ava Enna pictured after Surya loses his love are also excellently made except the background which could have been adjusted. Surya looks so smart in the army uniform and classy too! But Divya Spandana is not pretty at all but I guess this is her best...Other than that, the movie is worth 10 on 10 as a whole........Cheers to everyone!"
"Disappointing. The movie has its heart in the right place, yet it fails to strike a chord with ours. I enjoyed the first half but by the time the movie ends it all seemed vague and distant. I definitely wont agree with people who say that past intermission it was boring. For me, the whole movie failed. Remember tat wonderful scene from 'The Godfather' between Pacino and Marlon Brando before the latter dies? Had there been one scene in the movie like that it would have saved it. The scene where Surya does all the 'Bourne' stuff in New Delhi was not required one bit. Simran looked old when she was supposed to look young and vice-versa. Both Sameera & Divya were very pretty. Surya deserves special mention here for his acting, which was quite good. Harris's music as always was outstanding. But on the whole this movie just didn't work for me. P.S. Just give it a try. At least for Suriya."
"Supremely class film by Gautam. Bow to the man!
Ease with which suriya carries off this act is shocking."
"Vaarnam Aayiram, sounds like titled solely for the purpose of tax evasion doesn't live upto the expectations. The only consolation to audience is Surya.He fits perfectly to the dual role though the movie portrays much more of him. There is no wonder for such an excellent performance from the actor considering his acting talent. Simran's expressions could have been much more lively. Sameera has done a neat job in her charming screen-filling role. Divya's role is no more than just another character justified. Overall movie lacks originality with few unwanted English conversations making it look artificial and taking the very essence of emotions supposedly to be shown in few scenes. The romantic sequence between Surya and Sameera leaves a tender impression with few good dialogues. Songs and BGM are ordinary with one pleasing number ""Nenjukkul Peidhidum"" vocals from Hariharan. Gautam's direction is obvious throughout the movie and this is just another cap to his head without a feather."
"Even though Menon is a mediocre director who always tries to app the last English movie he has seen, this one is very bad. The joke is they thought they will show a boys evolution into man and did not have a good scene to show a brilliant actor a Surya a boy or as a man. He does not finish collage but makes enough money to build a house, finish off all the debts and fly to America and live in there for 90 days.

The worst Surya movie, worse than the old movies he made before he learn t to act."
"Vaaranam Aayiram is an Amazing Movie and I can't even find words to praise the entire crew for such a marvelous performance in every moment of this film..The way Surya is acting as a 15 year old Student or a Father role or a Military Major or a College Student is amazing and worthy and he proves that he is a good actor in the Tamil Film Industry.Sameera is simply superb and performed well. The way she is expressing on seeing Surya's expression in that Train Journey is simply superb. Also the way Surya is proposing to Sameera in that Train is great to watch.Divya is doing her best. She is somewhat looking too romantic over Surya and that expresses her love on him.Father Surya is superb. He is exactly resembling an Old man's mannerism. Simran is too good for this Mother Character.Sameera's proposal of her love to Surya is superb. Overall Vaaranam Aayiram is worthy for Tamil Movie Industry.Hats off to Gowtham Vasudev Menon, the Director of this movie. I know Gowtham. U paid tribute to your late father. Cameraman Rathnavelu did his best in this movie.."
